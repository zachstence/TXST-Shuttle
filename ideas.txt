- Collect data about routes (how long between stops, how long do they stop at each stop, etc)
  - when heading is 0 -> bus is stopped (might want to check off a velocity calculation to make sure)
- Predict if there is a train based off of if a bus is stopped for a long period of time at the tracks
- Predict what street they are on and what direction they're travelling based off of latitude, longitude, and bearing
- Make a web app that shows all of the above and more stuff. That way anybody can easily access and use it!
- Maybe have more complicated functions to calculate velocity based off more d, t points  or even previous known velocity for a higher accuracy? for now just going to do last 2
